## About <a name = "about"></a>

An osu! beatmap downloader that uses Beatconnect.io and Chimu.moe mirrors to download beatmaps from links stored in a text file and zips them afterwards. I made this because zipping mappools is a pain.

Python 3

Help

Download beatmaps from a list of links in a text file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f example.txt, --file example.txt
                        a text file containing beatmap links seperated by newline
  -n example.zip, --name example.zip
                        the name of the zip file to be created
  -o D:\match_pool\, --out D:\match_pool\
                        the directory where downloaded beatmaps are to be saved,
                        use this if you don't want the beatmaps to be deleted after zipping (make sure the folder exists)
```
